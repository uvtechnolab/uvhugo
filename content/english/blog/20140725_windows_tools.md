I’ll admit it: most of my work is still done on a Windows box.  Linux is used on my home server and of course at most of the clients Linux is used in the embedded systems or as server OS for the applications. But my laptops all use at least Windows, next to Linux in some cases.

So here is my list of free or open source tools that I immediately install on all of my machines:

* [Dropbox](http://www.dropbox.com/): Why Dropbox and not Drive, OneDrive, Box, SugarSync, Wuala, …? Well, because I used a [Google AdWords campain to max out my Dropbox at 19GB](http://vladik.rikhter.org/2011/09/22/maxing-out-your-dropbox-referrals-how-i-got-16gb-for-less-than-10/http://). So this is quite convenient.
* [Winsplit Revolution](http://winsplit-revolution.en.softonic.com/): I know Windows has application window management since Windows 7, however, in my opinion Winsplit Revolution is much easier to use and faster with the possibility of the key combinations.
* [Launchy](http://www.launchy.net/): Again, with the Windows key a lot of the same functionality can be achieved.  However, I let Launchy also index my Dropbox folder with the portable apps, so that at each new pc I always have all my tools under my fingertips.
* [7-zip](http://www.7-zip.org/): no need for any other (de)compression tools.
* [IrfanView](http://www.irfanview.com/): fastest image viewer and lightweight editor that can handle almost any image type, especially with the extra Plugins/Addons.
* [Paint.NET](http://www.getpaint.net/): already overkill for my graphical needs, but still easy to use and fast startup.
* [Sysinternals Suite](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb842062.aspx): there is always a useful tool in this suite, be it at least Autoruns.exe.
* [ConEmu](http://sourceforge.net/projects/conemu/): best command prompt replacement. Althoug I should take a look at [Cmdr](http://bliker.github.io/cmder/).  It wraps up ConEmu and Clink in a nice package.
* [Putty](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html): for your shell needs to Linux machines.
* [Clink](http://mridgers.github.io/clink/): to enhance your command prompt to the command line editing features of Bash.  So small, so very useful!
* [Notepad++](http://notepad-plus-plus.org/): immediately replace notepad.exe with this editor.  There are very useful plugins available.
* [Keepass](http://keepass.info/): I sure hope you are not using the same password for all websites and applications?  Keepass helps you keep track of these passwords.  I know Lastpass and other web applications provide the same functionality.  However, that makes them also the prime targets for hackers, so I’ll just keep track of them myself.
* [FreeFileSync](http://freefilesync.sourceforge.net/): so useful to easy sync files and folders between computers.  A tool like this is absolutely necessary to allow backs.  You do make backups, don’t you?
* [VLC](http://www.videolan.org/vlc/): forget about MediaPlayer, just install VLC and be done with it.
