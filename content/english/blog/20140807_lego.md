Lego has always been of big interest to me. From my first Lego City kits to my Mindstorms 1st generation kit, they were again and again very interesting to build and play with. Recently during our (almost) daily walk at work, we had a discussion on Lego and my colleague put it nicely: “with Lego you first and foremost build and then play, with PlayMobil you can only play”.

So I’m very happy that my son also has a keen interest in Lego. He creates the strangest cars, boats and airplanes, but it is very nice that a 7 year old isn’t hampered by any ideas how these things exactly should look like. He already has saved for and bought quite a few Lego City kits, especially those with trucks.  And the Lego folders are always within reach to select new kits.  Soon he will have a birthday party, which brings in extra cash, so he wants to select new kits.  So we had to look for the new folder, August – December 2014.  And Lego has upped the ante with it: they’ve included 3D functionality!

Words and pictures don’t do this justice, so look at the following clip (it’s from a Dutch shop, and the only one I could find on the Internet)

Lego seems to be very well in touch with new media and (perhaps by extension?) very succesful. Lego made a very nice movie about the early Lego history. You have to admit that the founder of Lego, Ole Kirk Christiansen, didn’t give up when hit by bad luck.

You can make a boring company video with the standard stuff in it. Lego chose to make an animated video, this of course appeals much more to the audience of Lego (children of 6 to 16). But also for adults, it is an interesting film.

From 1993 onwards sales slumped and although Lego tried to increase sales by increasing the number of sets and tried to innovate outside of the standard bricks, by 2003 the company was virtually out of cash. By cutting costs and focussing on the essence of Lego, Lego is now again a succesful company.
This history is described in a book “[Brick by Brick: How LEGO Reinvented Its Innovation System and Conquered the Toy Industry](http://www.robertsoninnovation.com/brick-by-brick/)”

Several summaries are online: [a brief one](http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/innovation-almost-bankrupted-lego-until-it-rebuilt-with-a-better-blueprint/ and [a longer one](http://www.google.nl/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=3&ved=0CDAQFjAC&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.strategy-business.com%2Farticle%2F07306%3Fpg%3Dall&ei=DNXhU6LPNMiTPZaTgcgC&usg=AFQjCNHEKUTvNrQhXe7GNZi7oDI8GuqTEw&sig2=H9iJT3VDjrVAlm61bocFXg&bvm=bv.72197243,d.ZWU&cad=rja or a comic version^$(http://www.robertsoninnovation.com/full-comic/) ([with Lego people of course](http://www.robertsoninnovation.com/full-comic/))

Now, many people say that Lego is becoming more expensive, but this does not seem to be the case. There is a well researched blog post on this matter, you can find it [here](http://therealityprose.wordpress.com/2013/01/17/what_happened_with_lego/).
The average price of a Lego set seems to have been quite steady since the 1990s:

**Update**: just in, a new look at the price of bricks in a set [on Wired](http://www.wired.com/2014/08/lego-cost/). You’ll get the most bang for your buck with the Trevi Fountain (21020) set.

Back to new media. Who hasn’t seen the new Lego Movie?

{{< youtube fZ_JOBCLF-I >}}

And with [an 8.0 IMDB score](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1490017/) it also is quite a good movie. Next to that, [the Lego videogames](http://http//www.metacritic.com/search/all/lego/results?sort=score) also get quite good Metacritic scores. You can’t go wrong with a Lego Batman, Hobbit or Star Wars game. for smartphones or tablets are also numerous free or paid games available, both for Apple as for [Android](https://play.google.com/store/search?q=lego&c=apps).

So I think we can conclude that Lego really is up to date with the digital media!
Don’t wait any longer and grab your old Lego kits and start building something.
