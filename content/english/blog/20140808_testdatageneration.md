As a tester you’ll often need to generate test data.  A lot can be achieved with Microsoft Excel or Open/LibreOffice Calc or any other spreadsheet. However there are tools specialized in generating test data.

Several commercial tools focus at generating big data, like those of [Grid-Tools](https://www.grid-tools.com/solutions/data-generation/), [Tricentis](http://www.tricentis.com/solutions/enterprise-testing-scenarios/big-data-applications) and probably several others. Since I haven’t used these, I’m not going to discuss them.

There are also several smaller, free tools that you can use!

* [GenerateData](http://www.generatedata.com/): open source data generator with lots of possible fields, even country specific ones. Very useful.
* [Fake Name Generator](http://www.fakenamegenerator.com/):generates a single identify for online use.  Especially useful for online social networks. Disadvantage is that it can’t generate a whole CVS files with hundreds or thousands of records.
* [Mockaroo](http://www.mockaroo.com/): seems simple, but it also allows regular expressions, so almost everything is possible.
* [Credit card numbers](http://www.darkcoding.net/credit-card-numbers/): has a list of fake credit card numbers conform to the MOD10 algorithm.
* [Identity generator](http://www.identitygenerator.com/): allows to generate various types of files with fake data, specific data fields for UK, US, Canada and the Netherlands are available.
* [TextMechanic](http://textmechanic.com/): not so much test data generation, as a set of tools to manipulate text online.
* [Random](http://www.random.org/): list of free and paid online tools to generate data, but also pick random data (times, dates, passwords, geographical data, …)
* [TypeIt](http://www.typeit.org/): if you need to test internationalization of your application. Generates/displays all characters in lots of character sets.
* [BabelCode](http://www.babelstone.co.uk/Unicode/unicode.html): slideshow of all possible unicode characters.  Needs more than 3 hours to display each character it knows!

In my opinion these are indispensable tools for any serious tester.  Add them to your bookmarks and start using them.
