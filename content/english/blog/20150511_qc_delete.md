Suppose you want to delete the link of a requirement to a testcase.

In ALM you then go to the testcase, select tab Requirements Coverage, select the requirement and delete that link, yes?

This is true, but do not delete the link with the Delete button on your keyboard, because ALM will be so kind to delete the complete testcase, no the link!
You really have to use the icon in the tab menu.
