Recently I made a very good deal on a used NI Maschine Mk1.

![Maschine Mk1](/images/blog/20160224/maschine-mk1-2.jpg#center)

It is a nifty musical device, includes lots of drum kits and allows me to quickly make some nice tracks (or better: musical snippets).  It’s lots of fun!

Another part of Maschine is that it really simplifies sampling, like this guy demonstrates:

&nbsp;  
Lots of people take old vinyl records and record a sample through a Numark record player.  I don’t have a Numark and I don’t have vinyl records. But I do have lots of CD’s ripped to mp3 files. Unfortunately Maschine doesn’t support mp3 files, only wav files.

How to convert them?

* Of course there is [Audacity](http://www.audacityteam.org/) and it even allows batch conversion, but it still is a too much work: open Audacity, open files, batch convert, close Audacity, …
* I’ve tried looking for programs that would allow me to right click the file in Windows Explorer and convert it. They are available, often install add/malware, but no free programs or they are way to heavy.  
&nbsp;

Solution: [Lame](http://lame.sourceforge.net/). Next to encoding files, it can also decode them with the –decode option.

Adding that command to the context menu can be done with [NirSoft FileTypesMan](http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/file_types_manager.html). (check out the other tools at NirSoft!) 
* Open FileTypesMan, 
* search for mp3, 
* Add new action ‘DecodeToWAV’. 
* For the command-line, browse to the directory where you put lame.exe and add ‘ –decode’. 

That’s it!

Right click samples in Explorer, select DecodeToWAV and moments later you have a .wav version in the same directory. Couldn’t be simpler.
