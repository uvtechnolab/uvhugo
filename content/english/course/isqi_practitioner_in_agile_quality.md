  list:
  - "The PAQ Competency Framework is based on the underlying knowledge, skills and behaviors that candidates need to demonstrate during both the PAQ course and practical assessment."
  - "Whilst these competencies and the framework look similar to learning outcomes and objectives found in many training courses, the critical difference is that the competencies are expressed in a manner that focuses on what a candidate ?can do? in terms of practical application of knowledge, skills and behaviors."
  - "The framework has been structured as follows:"
  - "Competency Area : 6 areas that are aligned to key practical attributes of the Agile Manifesto and 12 Principles."
  - "Competency Outcome : A statement for the Competency Area that defines what an Agile Practitioner is capable of achieving/demonstrating by meeting the competency requirements for that area. The areas and outcomes are listed below:"
  - "1. Agile Mindset: Prove that you can put into practice all the soft skills appropriate to the agile mindset aligned to the Agile Manifesto and principles."
  - "2. Faster Delivery: Optimise delivery through implementing efficiencies and effective practices, maximizing the work not done."
  - "3. Build Quality In: Implement the team activities to ensure the product quality objectives for each persona are met from inception throughout the product lifecycle."
  - "4. Engineering principles: Build the right product, right first time maximizing Business value using repeatable, auditable and adaptable processes, whilst minimizing technical debt."
  - "5. Continuous testing: Support the integration of code by iterating through a plan, build, test multiple times per day, in order to complete committed items aligned to acceptance criteria and the iteration definition of done."
  - "6. Scalability: Identify additional risks and changes required to effectively scale processes based on team size and/or distribution."

      info: 
        - "The PAQ exam is in the form of a **Competency Assessment** that verifies the practical application of  Agile principles. The assessment takes place at the end of the course, or it can be separately scheduled to be taken via remote proctor. Candidates who pass the assessment are awarded the PAQ certificate. Any candidate failing will have an opportunity to schedule a re-sit with their training provider."  
        - "The assessment is **hands-on** on where candidates are given a product backlog release which includes user stories, associated design documentation plus a *multi-drop* application seeded with defects."
        - "Candidates will be given instructions as to what is expected of them during the practical assessment and the opportunity to create the work products required."
        - "Each practical assessment will contain 1/2 additional scenario-based questions requiring written answers (up to 5 questions in total) that cover a selection of competencies. These written answers will be marked along with the answers to the product backlog release by an independent assessor."
        - "- Assessment duration: 2.5 hours."
        - "- Total Credits: 100 (90 credits from practical and 10 credits from the scenario based questions)"
        - "To pass candidates must score 60 credits (60%) in total."
        - "Accredited PAQ training is currently mandated to be eligible for the PAQ competency assessment."
