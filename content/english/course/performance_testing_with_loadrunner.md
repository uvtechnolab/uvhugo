  text:
  - "Performance is an important quality characteristic for many applications, ranging from web applications to applications running on mobile platforms. Having good performance is an essential part of providing a good user experience."
  - "Technically, performance efficiency is categorized in the [ISO25010](https://iso25000.com/index.php/en/iso-25000-standards/iso-25010)"
  - "Product Quality Model as a non-functional quality characteristic with the three subcharacteristics described below. Proper focus and prioritization depends on the risks assessed and the needs of the various stakeholders. Test results analysis may identify other areas of risk that need to be addressed."
  - "Microfocus LoadRunner is the industry standard performance testing tool. You can use LoadRunner to test the performance of static and dynamic resources."
  - "You can use JMeter to test the performance of static and dynamic resources."
  - "LoadRunner can be used to simulate load on a server, group of servers, network or object to test its strength and analyze overall performance under different load types."
  - "This training provides a practical, interactive learning experience with incremental lessons and labs that build upon one another."
