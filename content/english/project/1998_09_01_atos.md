## Developer

#### ATOS ORIGIN, EINDHOVEN, BELGIUM

Atos Origin was an IT services company. The branch in Veldhoven, TA-IPS (Technical Automation - In Product Software) was focused on the embbeded market in the region.  
After my studies I joined the company and followed the Academy Technical Automation training. This ran fulltime from September 1999 to December 1999. The first 2 months in Heerlen focused on embedded software with C and Ward&Mellor design techniques. The next 2 months at the Technical University Eindhoven (TUE) focused on object oriented software with OMT (Object Modelling Technique), a predecessor of UML.
I worked on several smaller projects in 1999.
