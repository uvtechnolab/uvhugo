## Test Automation Analyst

#### BANKSYS (NOW WORLDLINE), BRUSSELS, BELGIUM

Banksys (in 2006 acquired by WorldLine) is the most prominent provider of electronic payments in Belgium. It also creates payment terminals for shops. These are Linux based.  
My assignment was to temporarily expand the testing capacity for automated testing of these terminals, both the older version and the newer version, called Xenta. This was done with an in-house created framework that used the power of Python.
