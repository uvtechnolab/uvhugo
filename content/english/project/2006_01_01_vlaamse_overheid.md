## Performance Test Analyst

#### FLEMISH GOVERNMENT, BRUSSELS, BELGIUM


The Flemish Government has many IT systems and applications developed through tenders. Each of these applications need to be tested for performance before each release.

My responsibility was to test design and execute performance tests for these projects.
