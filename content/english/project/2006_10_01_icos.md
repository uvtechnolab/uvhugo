## Technical Test Analyst

#### ICOS VISION SYSTEMS (NOW KLA-TENCOR), LEUVEN, BELGIUM


ICOS Vision Systems develops and markets computer vision and inspection systems for controlling the production of integrated circuits and pcb's. ICOS has solidly anchored itself in the semi-conductor and electronics industry of the United States ('86), Japan ('89) and Southeast Asia ('92), and its customer list includes most of the world's major IC manufacturers. 

In 2008 ICOS Vision Systems was acquired by KLA-Tencor.

My responsibility was to test a high profile new vision inspection system for Intel. I created the test strategy, test plan and test cases to execute and executed these.
