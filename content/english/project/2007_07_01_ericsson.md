## Technical Test Analyst

#### ERICSSON, GILZE_RIJEN, THE NETHERLANDS


Ericsson is one of the leading providers of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) to service providers. They enable the full value of connectivity by creating game-changing technology and services that are easy to use, adopt, and scale, making our customers successful in a fully connected world.  
In Gilze-Rijen the Network Operations Center of Ericsson made telephone centrals. I worked there as a technical test analyst testing custom software for specific clients.
