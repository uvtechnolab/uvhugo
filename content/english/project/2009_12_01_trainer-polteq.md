## Test Trainer

#### FIFTHPLAY, ANTWERP, BELGIUM

ps_testware was a leading test consultancy company in Belgium. It also provided software testing trainings.  
In 2009 I started development of ISTQB Advanced Test Manager, Test Analyst and Technical Test Analyst trainings. I co-authored the book ISTQB Advanced Test Management.  
I worked nearly fulltime on providing trainings, updating all training materials and creating custom trainings for customers.
