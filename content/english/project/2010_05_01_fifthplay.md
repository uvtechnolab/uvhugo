## Senior Test Architect

#### FIFTHPLAY, ANTWERP, BELGIUM

Fifthplay is a Belgian high-tech player and a subsidiary of Niko Group. It helps leading brands turn homes and other buildings into smart living and working spaces. With a strong focus on energy management, climate and convenience. For greater comfort, safety, efficiency and control.  
At Fifthplay in 2010 there was no structured testing in place. I was tasked to improve software quality of home automation system by introducing lightweight testing processes, test analysis, test design and structured test exeuction and defect reporting.
