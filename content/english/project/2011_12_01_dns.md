## Test Assessment

#### DNS.BE, BRUSSELS, BELGIUM

DNS Belgium is a non-profit organisation responsible for managing the ccTLD .be top level domain, as well as the new gTLD domain extensions .brussels and .vlaanderen.  
During a few weeks, I assessed the testing processes of DNS.be and created an improvement plan.
