## Test Coaching

#### ORANGE, BRUSSELS, BELGIUM

Orange Belgium is a Belgian telecoms company.  
Their test team had many practical problems and questions. During a 2 month period I provided them on part-time basis with suggestions and improvements with regards to test processes, test design techniques etc.
