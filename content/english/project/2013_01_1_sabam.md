## Test Assessor

#### SABAM, BRUSSELS, BELGIUM

SABAM is one of the Belgian associations of authors, composers and publishers. The bilingual acronym stands for "Société d'Auteurs Belge – Belgische Auteurs Maatschappij".  It guarantees equitable compensation for the thousands of Belgian and foreign authors for whom they manage the rights.  
I executed a TPI assessment and provided a test improvement plan that they would implement.
