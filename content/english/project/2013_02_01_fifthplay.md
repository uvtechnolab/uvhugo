## Senior Test Architect

#### FIFTHPLAY, ANTWERP, BELGIUM

Fifthplay is a Belgian high-tech player and a subsidiary of Niko Group. It helps leading brands turn homes and other buildings into smart living and working spaces. With a strong focus on energy management, climate and convenience. For greater comfort, safety, efficiency and control.  
In my second assignment at Fifthplay I was responsible for designing and implementing a test automation architecture and test coordination of a complete test project for home automation system until a permanent employee was found.
