## Test Assessor

#### GROUP JOOS, HEVERLEE, BELGIUM

Group Joos is a large specialised printing company for large volumes of high-quality. It is the pioneer and trendsetter in direct mailings. These can be personalised and customised. These are processed in software batch programs.

The organization was introducing Agile working processes on an older software stack and organization and wanted to get an assessment on the current status and possible improvements.  We decided to use the TI4Agile method.
