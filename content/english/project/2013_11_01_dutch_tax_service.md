## TPI Next Test Assessor

#### DUTCH TAX SERVICE, APELDOORN, THE NETHERLANDS

The Dutch Tax Service is a large and complex software organization.  
In 2012 they had requested a TPI Next test assessment. In 2013 they requested a follow-up of the improvements made in the past year. With 6 colleagues from Polteq we did an in-depth TPI Next assessment of the software development organization.
