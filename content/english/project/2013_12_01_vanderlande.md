## Product Integration Test Specialist

#### VANDERLANDE, VEGHEL, THE NETHERLANDS

[Vanderlande](http://www.vanderlande.com/) is the global market leader for future-proof logistic process automation at airports, and in the parcel market.  They are also a leading supplier of process automation solutions for warehouses.  
At Vanderlande I first contributed to the success of the Operational Planning Management (OPM) component. Which is part of the software suite VIBES. Backend of OPM is built on Oracle enterprise technology (database + JEE application server) in Java. The frontend is a WPF application written in C#/.NET. In the OPM team I was responsible for the day-to-day testing, test automation and Agile process improvement.  
In the OPM team I helped transition the automated testing from UFT to an in-house developed test automation solution based on .NET, Selenium and our own solution build on top of Windows UI Automation.  
Later I was asked to work to help release the VIBES software as a product, helping transition the organisation from a project focused organisation to a product focused organisation. In this role I was responsible for the total product integration testing of the VIBES suite. VIBES is used in smaller airports like Gothenburg, medium airports like Vancouver and very large airports like Heathrow.
