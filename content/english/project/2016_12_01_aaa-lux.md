## Test Coach

#### AAA-LUX, EINDHOVEN, THE NETHERLANDS

[AAA-LUX](https://aaa-lux-lighting.com/) is a manufacturer of LED flood lighting for high mast applications.
They focus on sport-at-large, sport stadiums and industrial applications such as ports, airports, parkings, 24/7 industry. With dimmable lighting solutions AAA-LUX customers save on energy consumption, CO2 emissions and maintenance cost.  
In this part-time assignment I expanded the small development team with testing capacity. Executed manual tests on IoT systems with ZigBee communication, set up small test automation with AutoIt in .NET and introduced a testing mindset in the organization.
