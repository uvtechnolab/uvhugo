## Test Assessor

#### WOLTERS KLUWER, HASSELT, BELGIUM

Wolters Kluwer is a global provider of professional information, software solutions, and services.  They create tax and accounting software for accountants and entrepeneurs.  In Belgium the tax laws were split from solely a federal responsibility to federal and regional responsibilities. Both the software and their development/testing processes were not suited to accomodate for this change.
A colleague and myself were requested to assess the software and organization to see how this could be improved. We use the [TI4Agile](https://www.polteq.com/en/testservices/ti4agile/) test improvement model to assess the organization and find improvement suggestions.
