## Quality Coach, Test Automator

#### ROBOJOB, HEIST-OP-DEN-BERG, BELGIUM

[Robojob](https://www.robojob.eu) is a very innovative small company working on automating CNC machines. They have been building low-threshold and user-friendly solutions for nearly 15 years that can significantly increase the yield, flexibility and efficiency of client's machine park.

Robojob had no structured testing and needed to improve their qualilty since their solutions would be sold by a large CNC OEM.  In the year I worked at Robojob I set up a structured test process in the small development team. This allowed for pragmatic testing through the use of test automation.  I implemented a Java test automation framework for the integrated system controlling a robotic arm loading/unloading CNC machines.  The application used a JavaFX GUI that could be tested through the [TestFX library](https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX) using Page Object models.
