## Unit Testing Trainer

#### ASML, EINDHOVEN, THE NETHERLANDS

ASML gives the world's leading chipmakers the power to mass produce patterns on silicon, helping to make computer chips smaller, faster and greener. They are THE leading producer of lithography machines that are an essential component in chip manufacturing.  Their customers are companies such as Intel, who use our machines in ‘fabs’ – microchip manufacturing plants – to create microchips that are eventually used in many electronic devices, including smartphones, laptops and much more.  
I was hired to give unit testing training services to all their C and C++ developers in the Eindhoven HQ. Helped to create a 3-day "unit testing in C/C++" training partly based on my own ISTQB Foundation training material and Google Test.  In total I have trained several hundreds developers and testers in unit testing.  
From May 2018 to June 2019 this was on nearly full-time basis, since then it has been on ad-hoc basis.
