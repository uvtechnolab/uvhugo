## Test Assessor & Coach

#### SCK•CEN, MOL, BELGIUM

Founded in 1952, SCK•CEN is the Belgian nuclear research centre. It focuses on nuclear safety and radiation protection, medical and industrial applications of radiation, nuclear reprocessing and management of radioactive waste and others.  
For the Dosimetry project I was asked to assess their testing processess, suggest improvements and implement these within a coaching assigment of 15 days in total. I introduced risk-based testing, structuring of test cases in Visual Studio and started with a test automation framework in .NET.
