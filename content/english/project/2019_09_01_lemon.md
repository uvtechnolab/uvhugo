## Test Assessor

#### LEMON COMPANIES, KONTICH, BELGIUM

[Lemon](https://www.lemon.be) offers a wide range of IT services. And they love technology in all types of forms: from user experiences, user interfaces (UX/UI) and smart websites to dynamic software, Internet of Things platforms and IT support for the launch of creative and innovative ideas.  
I was asked to assess the testing processes of a new large project they were starting for a new important customer. This project was their largest to date and very high profile.  
During a few days I made improvement suggestions on their Agile and testing processes.
