## Quality Coach, Test Automator

#### CENTRICA (REstore), BERCHEM, BELGIUM

REstore was a Belgian start-up in the energy sector. In 2017 [Centrica Business Solutions](https://www.centricabusinesssolutions.com/) bought REstore to enhance their portfolio.  It focuses on helping Grid Operators like Elia in Belgium [balancing the electrical grid](https://www.elia.be/en/grid-data/balancing).  
In the year I worked at Centrica I was involved in improving the quality of various projects related to energy Demand & Response solutions.  In these projects we used the [Serenity-BDD](http://www.thucydides.info/) framework with the ScreenPlay pattern in [Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org/).  
Test improvement achievements include improving the quality of the test automation code for better maintainability, introducing risk-based testing and creating a test strategy to have focused testing.
